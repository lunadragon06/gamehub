<img src="src/assets/screenshot.png" alt="GameHub website mockup.">

## üìú Description
I used one of my WordPress API which I have had since 1st year at Noroff Vocational School while working on this assignment and practiced Reactjs throughout this entire course. In short, this API belongs to my cross-course project which I have used and still am using when I'm practicing the core coding languages HTML, CSS, SASS/SCSS and JavaScript in addition to ReactJS and NEXTjs.

<br>
Live site to this project does currently not exsist, but we can run it locally on our computers by following the installation guidelines below üëá
### This project contains üîç
- [x] An array of games from homepage. 
- [x] A single game is retrieved by a parameter (id). Each result are linked to a detail page, passing a parameter in URL. 
- [x] One of the forms are making a login request to a Wordpress API with JWT plugin installed.
  - If the login is unsuccessful, an error message will be displayed above the login form. 
  - And if the login is successful, we will be redirected to an admin page (route).
- [x] Simple contact form where inputted contact info will be sent directly to my professional (private) email, which was added with [EmailJS](https://blog.openreplay.com/sending-emails-from-react-with-emailjs/).
- [ ] New functionalities and overall improvements for this website are considered to be done during 2023 sometime after Portfolio 2's marked.
#### Login info üîê
Please use your own WP local installation to be able to use admin functionality to this site. I used [this guide](https://themeisle.com/blog/install-xampp-and-wordpress-locally/) first before I configured my JWT auth in Wordpress REST API by following [this video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/520281229/d3f527f43e) to be set as authorised, and in this case be able to, for instance, using login form. 
## üîß Build With
I used [JWT Authentication for WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/) among these following tech packages and WordPress plugin(s) to build this React Web Application:
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-with/react)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) (API json only) 
## üë©‚Äçüíª Backend
In case you're having trouble making JWT Authentication for WP REST API working for you after following the guidelines from above, try to replace the following code in your ``.htacess`` file (which worked for me when I tried): 
```bash
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
RewriteBase /your-project-name-here/
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /your-project-name-here/index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```
Replace ``your-project-name-here`` with the actual name of your installed WP folder, which you've named yourself before your WP installation.
